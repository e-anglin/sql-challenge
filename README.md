# sql-challenge
Many thanks are needed to my co-worker Mike, who helped set me up my table schemata during my break at work, using MariaDB on the terminal prompt. I also checked stackoverflow for the description of each 'JOIN', and how to search for a name that begins with a certain letter in Postgresql, as well as databasefaqs for inserting single quotes in Postgresql.
Other than that, I did not have to use a tutor to finish the homework.
